| Choose a player to go first. That player throws the dice and scores as many points as the total shown on the dice, providing neither die doesnâ€™t show a 1.|
| If one 1 is rolled, the player loses their points for their turn and passes their turn to the next player |
| If two 1s are rolled, the player loses their entire points total and passes their turn to the next player |
| Players may roll until they decide they'd like to hold, adding their accumulated turn score to their total score - or until a 1 is rolled |
| A player wins when their score reaches 100 |
